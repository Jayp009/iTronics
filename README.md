Problem:-
According to a government survey, each year more than 150 people die in the state of Gujarat due to electrocution caused from light/electricity poles which leak high voltage current in the monsoon season.

Solution:-
We have developed a low-cost, low power(solar-powered) IoT node which can be fixed on any electricity/light pole which cuts off the power to the pole as soon as it detects that current is leaking from the pole. It also detects if the pole is fallen(and there are live high voltage cables lying around) and sends all this data to the city command and control centre so that they can come for maintenance ASAP.
As a double security measure it flashes LEDs and sounds an alarm on the pole so citizens nearby can stay aware and safe.
We are using ESP8266, LiPo battery ,LED, Buzzer, Relays, Water Sensor, Current sensor.
